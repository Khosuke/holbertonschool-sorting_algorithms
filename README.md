# Project C - sorting_algorithms

Task 0 - Write a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Bubble sort algorithm
Write in the file 0-O, the big O notations of the time complexity of the Bubble sort algorithm, with 1 notation per line:
 1: in the best case
 2: in the average case
 3: in the worst case
File: 0-bubble_sort.c, 0-O

Task 1 - Write a function that sorts a doubly linked list of integers in ascending order using the Insertion sort algorithm
Write in the file 1-O, the big O notations of the time complexity of the Insertion sort algorithm, with 1 notation per line:
 1: in the best case
 2: in the average case
 3: in the worst case
File: 1-insertion_sort_list.c, 1-O

Task 2 - Write a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Selection sort algorithm
Write in the file 2-O, the big O notations of the time complexity of the Selection sort algorithm, with 1 notation per line:
 1: in the best case
 2: in the average case
 3: in the worst case
File: 2-selection_sort.c, 2-O

Task 3 - Write a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Quick sort algorithm
Write in the file 3-O, the big O notations of the time complexity of the Quick sort algorithm, with 1 notation per line:
